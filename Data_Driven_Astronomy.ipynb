    "In this activity, we're going to use decision trees to determine the redshifts of galaxies from their photometric colours. We'll use galaxies where accurate spectroscopic redshifts have been calculated as our gold standard. We will learn how to assess the accuracy of the decision trees predictions and have a look at validation of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also have a quick look at how this problem might be approached without using machine learning. This will highlight some of the limitations of the classical approach and demonstrate why a machine learning approach is ideal for this type of problem.\n",

    "If you want to run your code offline, you can download the full NumPy dataset for this activity here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity is based on the scikit-learn example on Photometric Redshifts of Galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magnitudes and colours\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using flux magnitudes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue to create colour indices. Flux magnitudes are the total flux (or light) received in five frequency bands (u, g, r, i and z).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The astronomical colour (or colour index)* is the difference between the magnitudes of two filters, i.e. *u - g* or *i - z*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This index is one way to characterise the colours of galaxies. For example, if the *u-g* index is high then the object is brighter in ultra violet frequencies than it is in visible green frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colour indices act as an approximation for the spectrum of the object and are useful for classifying stars into different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What data do we need?\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the redshift of a distant galaxy, the most accurate method is to observe the optical emission lines and measure the shift in wavelength. However, this process can be time consuming and is thus infeasible for large samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many galaxies we simply don't have spectroscopic observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can calculate the redshift by measuring the flux using a number of different filters and comparing this to models of what we expect galaxies to look like at different redshifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will use machine learning to obtain photometric redshifts for a large sample of galaxies. We will use the colour indices (u-g, g-i, r-i and i-z) as our input and a subset of sources with spectroscopic redshifts as the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision tree algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a tool that can be used for both classification and regression. In this module we will look at regression, however, in the next module we will see how they can be used as classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees map a set of input features to their corresponding output targets. This is done through a series of individual decisions where each decision represents a node (or branching) of the tree.\n",

    "Each node represents a decision that the robot needs to make (or assess) to reach a final decision. In this example, the decision tree will be passed a set of input features (Outlook, Humidity and Wind) and will return an output of whether to play or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision trees for regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In decision trees for real-world tasks, each decision is typically more complex, involving measured values, not just categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the input values for humidity being Normal or High and wind being Strong or Weak we might see a percentage between 0 and 100 for humidity and a wind speed in km/hr for wind. Our decisions might then be humidity < 40% or wind < 5 km/hr.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of regression is a real number. So, instead of the two outputs of <font color='blue'>Play</font> and <font color='blue'>Don't Play </font>we have a probability of whether we will play that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision at each branch is determined from the training data by the decision tree learning algorithm. Each algorithm employs a different metric (e.g. `Gini impurity` or `information gain`) to find the decision that splits the data most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, just need to know that a decision tree is a series of decisions, each made on a single feature of the data. The end point of all the branches is a set of desired target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision trees in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to our decision tree are the colour indices from photometric imaging and our output is a photometric redshift. Our training data uses accurate spectroscopic measurements.\n",

The model would be quite complex; based on the above plot, a dampened inverse sine function would be a good starting point for such a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could try such an approach the function would be overly complex and there is no guarantee that it would yield very promising results. Another approach would be to plot a colour-index vs colour-index plot using an additional colour scale to show redshift. The following plot is an example of such a plot.\n",

If we were to make a contour map of the redshifts in the colour index vs colour index space we would be able to get an estimate of the redshift for new data points based on a combination of their colour indices. This would lead to redshift estimates with significant uncertainties attached to them.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will be using machine learning to classify galaxies into three types (ellipticals, spirals or galactic mergers) based on their observed properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last activity you had a go at classifying galaxies by hand on the [Galaxy Zoo website](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/#/classify) which hopefully gave you some intuition for the dataset and how we can distinguish between the different types of galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our machine learning experiments, we are using the crowd-classified classes from Galaxy Zoo as the training data for our automatic decision tree classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by looking at how classification differs from regression. We will then implement some of the new features and parameters that we will use to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We will also show you how to measure accuracy for classification problems, before extending our classifier to use random forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to try this on your own machine, the data set can be downloaded [here](https://groklearning-cdn.com/modules/jSAg5N3xrpKtvpDtCtMTGV/galaxy_catalogue.npy).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification vs Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, the predictions are from a fixed set of classes, whereas in regression the prediction typically corresponds to a continuum of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, we measure accuracy by looking at the size of the differences between the predicted values and the actual values. In contrast, in classification problems a prediction can either be correct or incorrect. This makes measuring the accuracy of our model a lot simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation using decision trees, there is very little difference between classification and regression. The only notable difference is that our targets are classes rather than real values. When calculating the accuracy, we check whether the predicted class matches as the actual class.\n",
    "A note on decision tree regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In decision tree regression, the possible outputs are a finite set of values that correspond to the number of leaves/end points in the tree. Ideally we want as many points as possible to give a good approximation of the 'continuous' parameter space, whilst avoiding overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Galaxy Zoo data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last activity, you were a human classifier for the [Galaxy Zoo project](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/#/classify) and probably saw a wide range of galaxy types observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In this activity, we will limit our dataset to three types of galaxy: spirals, ellipticals and mergers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='week6/Classes.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "The galaxy catalogue we are using is a sample of galaxies where at least 20 human classifiers (such as yourself) have come to a consensus on the galaxy type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of spiral and elliptical galaxies were selected where there was a unanimous classification. Due to low sample numbers, we included merger examples where at least 80% of human classifiers selected the merger class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need this high quality data to train our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deciding on features\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the regression activities, we need to decide on a set of key features that represent our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While approaches exist that determine their own feature representation and use the raw pixel values as inputs, e.g. neural networks and deep learning, the majority of existing machine learning in astronomy requires an expert to design the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we will be using a set of features derived from fitting images according to known galaxy profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the features we use here are based on the five observed flux magnitudes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='week6/sdss_filters.png', width=600, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting features\n",
    "\n",
    "The features that we will be using to do our galaxy classification are colour index, adaptive moments, eccentricities and concentrations. These features are provided as part of the SDSS catalogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly describe these below. Further information how they are calculated can be found [here](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr7/en/help/docs/algorithm.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colour indices** are the same colours (u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z) we used for regression. Studies of galaxy evolution tell us that spiral galaxies have younger star populations and therefore are 'bluer' (brighter at lower wavelengths). Elliptical galaxies have an older star population and are brighter at higher wavelengths ('redder').\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eccentricity** approximates the shape of the galaxy by fitting an ellipse to its profile. Eccentricity is the ratio of the two axis (semi-major and semi-minor). The De Vaucouleurs model was used to attain these two axis. To simplify our experiments, we will use the median eccentricity across the 5 filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='week6/eccentricity_example.png', width=400, height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting features - continued\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive moments also describe the shape of a galaxy. They are used in image analysis to detect similar objects at different sizes and orientations. We use the fourth moment here for each band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concentration is similar to the luminosity profile of the galaxy, which measures what proportion of a galaxy's total light is emitted within what radius. A simplified way to represent this is to take the ratio of the radii containing 50% and 90% of the Petrosian flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Petrosian method allows us to compare the radial profiles of galaxies at different distances. If you are interested, you can [read more here](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys443/lectures/gal_1/petro/petro.html) on the need for Petrosian approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these experiments, we will define concentration as:\n",
    "\n",
